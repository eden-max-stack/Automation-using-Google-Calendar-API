# Automation-using-Google-Calendar-API
This project is a very basic prototype/simulation to automate event handling using Google Calendar API.

The files contain 2 python files - app.py and main.py, out of which the former contains the code to create webforms and render HTML files using Flask, and the latter to connect with Google Calendar. 

The various HTML files are to style/structure the webforms created.

The credentials.json file is obtained from Google Cloud Console, which you can find a tutorial for from [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python).

I have plans on making it a useful project in the future, and hence will keep making contributions.

I personally found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2E82UPUnOY&t=1029s) helpful.
